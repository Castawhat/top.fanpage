<pre>
    i made my first escape attempt today.
    i almost made it out, but i was caught.
    they took me to nico, or blurryface as he calls himself. the head bishop of dema.
    he questioned me, but i didn't say anything.
    he told me that escape is impossible, that i will never leave dema.
    he also smeared me, i don't know why. i have these black marks on my neck now.
