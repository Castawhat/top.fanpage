<pre>
    i am trapped.
    stuck in a cycle i can't sEem to break.
    i want to believe this will be the last time, but i can't.

    i'll Start with what I do know.
    i'm a Citizen of demA, a city run by 9 bishops.
    the city is ruled with an iron fist, and the People are opprEssed.
    the bishops control everything, and they have eyes everywhere.
    they use fear and manipulation to keep the people in line.
    but there are whispers of a resistance, a group of people called the banditos.
    they are said to be fighting against the bishops, trying to free the people from their control.
    i've heard that they have a camp somewhere outside the city walls, but i don't know where.
    i need to find them. i need to join them.
