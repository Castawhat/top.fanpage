<pre>
    yesterday i came face to face with the bishops.
    they didn't recognize me, but i recognized them.
    i've seen them before, in the annual assemblage of the glorified.

    they are the ones who keep me in this cycle.
    they are the ones who control everything.
    we are seperated into districts, each ruled by a bishop.
    i am from DST. SARCAVER, ruled by sarcaver.

    i learnt one thing i need to know today.
    east is up.
    i need to remember that.
    they rotate the directions in dema, so its harder to escape.
    east is the way out.
